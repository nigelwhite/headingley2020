					<h2 class="uk-text-center">Moderation</h2>
					<p class="uk-margin-large-top">
						Such is the level of residents' respect for each other
						that deliberate moderation has rarely been necessary. We
						guess this is because of our shared understanding that
						building community is more important than 'winning'
						debates. Please see our
						<a href="ethics.html">ethics</a> for more on this.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, moderation is available to us, as a community.
						Starting with light-touch approaches and escalating with
						seriousness, these are......
					</p>
					<p>
						1. Moderation by our members. If people don't appreciate
						the tone of a discussion members expresses their
						dissaproval in email messages on the network itself.
					</p>
					<p>
						2. Personal requests to cool it, in a private email to
						an individual member.
					</p>
					<p>
						3. A 'quiet word' from the admin team, or from
						Headingley Network, reminding of our
						<a href="ethics.html">ethics</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since 2004 there has only been one occasion when
						stronger measures were needed. Again there are a range
						of strategies available to the admin team, in
						consultation with respected community members -
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							every email by a member can be held till manually
							approved
						</li>
						<li>
							a member can have their membership temporarily or
							peremanently removed
						</li>
					</ul>
