						headingley.org does not take a neutral position.
						headingley.org is for those discussions which are
						community-strengthening. It is not for general
						discussions.
					</p>

					<p>
						All sorts of supportive and positive messages have been
						exchanged since 2004. This is possible when residents
						(especially new residents) feel comfortable reaching out
						to others, in the knowledge that they will be received
						kindly, with respect and good will. headingley.org is
						here as a platform to help that happen.
					</p>

					<p>
						headingley.org's aim is to increase community
						resilience. When residents interact and support each
						other, in daily life, we discover interconnections
						within our community. This has all sorts of benefits.
						These benefits come about informally, spontaneously,
						maybe off-list, as we find new ways of supporting each
						other, which fit the needs of the moment. Supportive
						exchanges in our home community enhance our lives and
						bring us happiness.
					</p>

					<p>
						So headingley.org is for community-strengthening
						discussions rather than general discussions. It is here
						as a platform for times when we want to create, enhance
						and strengthen community interconnections. This means
						choosing not to air some things, not because you don't
						think them, but because they may set everyone at
						loggerheads. headingley.org is not here for general
						discussion of this or that. It is here for, "how can we
						help each other with this or that?"
					</p>

					<p>
						Sometimes it is hard to judge..... there may be grey
						areas..... one person's rant could be another person's
						reasonable statement. Hopefully, if you keep these
						stated aims in your mind as you write, everyone will
						feel at ease.
