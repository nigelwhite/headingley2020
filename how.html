						How to use the email networks
					</h2>
					<p class="uk-margin-large-top">
						This web site gives access to three email networks for
						Headingley residents - Chat, Triangle and Activists.
						Applications to subscribe are filtered by our wonderful
						team of volunteers. As they are residents themselves,
						they can recognise a spammer a mile off.
					</p>

					<p>How to send an email to all subscribers of a network</p>
					<p class="inset-my">
						When you are subscribed to a network, send an ordinary
						email to the network's address. A copy of your email is
						forwarded to all subscribers.
					</p>

					<p>How to reply to all subscribers</p>
					<p class="inset-my">
						This is the default when you click 'Reply' in your email
						software. A new window will open. If you check the To:
						field you will see it is pre-filled with the network's
						address. NB. this can vary depending on your email
						software.
					</p>

					<p>
						What if I want to send my reply to only the original
						sender?
					</p>
					<p class="inset-my">
						Look in the headers of the incoming email to find the
						original sender's email address. Remove the network's
						address from the To: field and insert the original
						sender's address.
					</p>

					<p>How to get a new password</p>
					<p class="inset-my">
						You have a different password for each of the 3 email
						networks. If you want to change your password see these
						instructions.
					</p>

					<p>
						How to change your mailing settings (unsubscribe, change
						email addresss, etc)
					</p>
					<p class="inset-my">
						You can do this yourself. If that is too daunting you
						can ask our volunteer team to
						<a href="please.html">do it for you</a>.
					</p>

					<p>How to remove your data</p>
					<p class="inset-my">
						The system only stores your email address. When you
						unsubscribe from each network, your email is deleted.
					</p>

					<p>How to spread the word</p>
					<p class="inset-my">
						By word of mouth. Please
						<a href="promote.html">promote headingley.org</a>
