						Our aim is to promote a balanced, diverse and
						sustainable community through developing community
						resiliance, especially in the form of non-economic
						co-operation. So we actively promote social enterprises
						and community-based organisations.
					</p>

					<p>
						Our mailing lists are for individuals and community
						groups in Headingley to:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							seek support for community events and community
							ventures (like farmers market, chicken coop and
							HEART)
						</li>
						<li>
							share recommendations on local tradesmen and
							businesses who they believe will do a good job and
							are good for the Headingley community
						</li>
						<li>
							sell cheaply or give away personal property that is
							no longer wanted
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>For this reason please use the mailing lists if:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							you are promoting a business as a customer and are
							prepared to endorse the business or
						</li>
						<li>
							you are promoting an event that is either organised
							by a Headingley community group or is directly for
							the benefit of the community
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>NB. one-off private sales are not businesses</p>
					<p>
						We ask that users do not advertise commercial
						businesses, big or small. There are enough other places
						for that.
					</p>

					<p>Thank you</p>
